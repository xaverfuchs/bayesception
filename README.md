R implementations of Bayesian spatiotemporal integration in perception

This project deals with Bayesian models of perceptual spatiotemporal perception put forth by Dr. Daniel Goldreich as desribed in this article:

Goldreich, D., & Tong, J. (2013). Prediction, Postdiction, and Perceptual Length Contraction: A Bayesian Low-Speed Prior Captures the Cutaneous Rabbit and Related Illusions. Frontiers in Psychology, 4. https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00221

The aim is to implement R code and reproduce some of the analyses and figures from the article with the goal in mind to make the models more accessible and applicable for data analysis in the free and open [R programming language](https://cran.r-project.org/).
